Custom CNN and Generative Adversarial Network for image colorization 

This is an image colorization project using Generative Adversarial Network(GAN). Where a custom architecture is used which was trained on a subset of the original dataset for 10 epochs. This project is not fine tuned but it has the potential to perform well.
